          <h3>background</h3>
          <p>It's not a question of <strong>if</strong> but <strong>when</strong> that automation will come to every corner of our society... It all started back in early January 2021, while I was alone in my one bedroom apartment in Miami and thinking about my career after graduation, I acidentally stumbled upon the idea of a robotic chef. At the time, it was already the last semseter of Junior year. School work starts to stack up and get difficult when you get to those high level major classes. This resulted in a very tight schedule. I tried to get rid of as much unnecessaire activites as possible. However, eating is not among those. In fact, having a healthy routine diet is more important than anything else. But I could barely find time to eat, given this busy schedule</P>

        <h3>problem with current dining options</h3>
        <p> I knew this is probably not just me. Many other people, from my peers to some 50 year-old with a 9 to 5 job. The reason I felt this strongly than others is because , prior to college, all my life, I went to boarding schools where they have dinning halls ,and three meals are available 7 days a week. But now things have changed. The first two years of college, classes weren't that intense. I was able to cook or get takeouts occasionally. Resturants are usually saved for weekends. But now, I just want to do it like in the old days where I could just take a 5 minutes walk to the dinning hall and eat and come back without worring about dishes and meal planning and cooking.</p>

        <h3>current solutions</h3>
        <p>What are some other current solutions besides cooking yourselves? Takeouts/deliveries looks like a good fit. No need for cooking and cleaning. But are you willing to pay the rising labor costs that is going to get a lot worse in the coming years. Platforms like Doordash and Uber are looking to become profitable as now they are subsidizing the the rides with investors money-----------meaning more fees per order.</p>

      <div id="now">
        <h3>Why now</h3>
        <p>As the adoption of 5G accerlates over the next few years, that will enable large data consuming IoT to work smoothly. Autnoumous veichle is a great example of that. Hence, now is the best time to automate kitchens. The raitonale and basic logic behind this is, when a problem as complex and unpredictable as driving can be solved by cameras and lidars coupled with AI, there is no reason that a routine and very predictable task like cooking one's dinner can't be solved. Therefore, autonoumous kitchnen is not something very lofty to pursue. </p>
