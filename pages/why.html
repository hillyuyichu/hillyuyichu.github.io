        <h2>Why do we need Autonomous Home Kitchen ?</h2>
        <p><i>Solving a long overdue problem that every household has.</i></p>

          <h3>Background</h3>
          <p>It's not a question of <strong>if</strong> but <strong>when</strong> that automation will come to every corner of our society... It all started back in early January 2021, while I was alone in my one bedroom apartment in Miami and thinking about my career after graduation, I acidentally stumbled upon the idea of a robotic chef. At the time, it was already the last semseter of Junior year. School work starts to stack up and get difficult when you get to those high level major classes. This resulted in a very tight schedule. I tried to do as less unnecessary activites as possible. However, eating is not among those. In fact, eating well is more important than anything else. But I could barely find time to eat, given this busy schedule.</P>

      <div id="problemcurrent">
        <h3>Major problem</h3>
        <p> I knew this is probably not just me but also many other people, ranging from my peers to parents with a 9 to 5 job. The reason I felt this strongly than others is because , prior to college, all my life, I went to boarding schools where they have dinning halls ,and three meals are available 7 days a week. But now things have changed. The first two years of college, classes weren't that intense. I was able to cook and get takeouts when tired. Resturants are not cost effective and usually saved for weekends. But now, I just want to eat like in the old days where I could just take a 5 minutes walk to the dinning hall and eat and come back without worring about dishes and meal planning and cooking, etc.</p>

      <div id="currentsolutions">
        <h3>Current solutions</h3>
        <p>What are some other current solutions besides cooking yourselves? Takeouts/deliveries looks like a good fit. No need for cooking and cleaning. But are you willing to pay the rising labor costs that is going to get a lot worse in the coming years. Quality takeouts and resturants also come with a premium cost and are very time consuming. </p>
      </div>
      <div id="now">
        <h3>Why now</h3>
        <p>As the adoption of 5G accerlates, that will enable large data consuming IoT to work smoothly. The raitonale and basic logic behind this is, when a problem as complex and unpredictable as driving can be solved by cameras and lidars coupled with AI, there is no reason that a routine and very predictable task like cooking one's dinner can't be solved. The other contributing factor is the trend of working remotely. Major companies like Google, Facebook and Apple,etc, have announced that remote working is going to be a option for certain employees permenantly. This alone could increase the time people spent at home. Hence, the meals eaten at home increase.</p>
